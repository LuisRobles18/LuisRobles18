### Hi there! My name is Luis and thanks for visiting my Github personal profile! 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm a Ph.D. student/Research Assistant from the Computer Science Department at Georgia State University. I'm currently working on the Panacea Lab: http://www.panacealab.org/ 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Machine Learning and Natural Language processing applications (such as training models, fine-tuning transformer models using weak-supervision) to generate insights from unstructured data scrapped from social networks (normally from Twitter by using its API).

Additionally, I'm currently working with standardized databases related to Electronic Health Records (ENHR), such as OMOP from the Common Data Model. Specifically, I'm working on converting databases (which contains EHR) with a different schema, to a standard OMOP CDM database.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning in applying more transformer-based pretrained models for health-related tasks: https://mr-nlp.github.io/posts/2021/05/transformer-based-biomedical-pretrained-language-models-list/

Moreover, I'm currently learning the OMOP Common Data Model: https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/
